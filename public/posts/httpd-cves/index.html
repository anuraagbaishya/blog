      <p>After an almost 5 month hiatus, due to life events (and other insignificant events), I am back analyzing CVEs. This time I decided to challenge myself to pick something where I was completely out of depth. I decided to look at the Apache HTTP Server, and understand how CVEs were patched by looking at diffs in its code across versions.</p>
<p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> (httpd) is a powerful, open-source web server that powers a significant portion of the internet. It’s highly configurable, allowing users to host websites, serve dynamic content, and handle requests efficiently. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular Architecture: Easily extendable via modules like mod_rewrite for URL manipulation or mod_ssl for secure connections.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform: Runs on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.</li>
<li>Scalability: Supports both small personal websites and large-scale enterprise applications.
Customization: Through configuration files, you can fine-tune security, performance, and URL handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when I first came across httpd. The only thing I know about httpd is that its a server used to serve websites. I do not how to use it, what features it has, and how to configure it. Through some life experiences, I learnt about the modular architecture of httpd. Even then I mostly know names like <code>mod_proxy</code>, <code>mod_rewrite</code>, <code>mod_ssl</code>, but I have never looked deeper into them.</p>
<p>Another thing I am almost illiterate in is the language C. I cannot write any C code beyond what I learnt in high school or my freshmen year of undergrad. Like all things in life, I was drawn to the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; uses of code - such as Android apps and fancy websites. So, I learnt Java, Python, and tried learning JavaScript and node.js. I also never had to host a production grade website, so I never looked in to servers like httpd or nginx. The only websites I have hosted - like my personal website(s) or this blog - have been built on frameworks which require minimal server configuration. Shoutout to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for making it incredibly simple to host this blog!</p>
<p>I will look at 2 CVEs in <code>mod_rewrite</code> (CVE-2024-38474, CVE-2024-38475) and 2 in <code>mod_proxy</code> (CVE-2024-38473, CVE-2024-38477). All these CVEs were fixed in httpd 2.4.60.</p>
<h2 id="mod_rewrite">mod_rewrite</h2>
<p>From the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html">official documetation</a>: The mod_rewrite module uses a rule-based rewriting engine, based on a PCRE regular-expression parser, to rewrite requested URLs on the fly. By default, mod_rewrite maps a URL to a filesystem path. However, it can also be used to redirect one URL to another URL, or to invoke an internal proxy fetch. <code>mod_rewrite</code> provides a flexible and powerful way to manipulate URLs using an unlimited number of rules. Each rule can have an unlimited number of attached rule conditions, to allow you to rewrite URL based on server variables, environment variables, HTTP headers, or time stamps.</p>
<h3 id="cve-2024-38474">CVE-2024-38474</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38474">CVE-2024-38474</a> is a CVE in <code>mod_rewrite</code>, where a substitution encoding issue allows attackers to execute scripts in directories that are allowed by the server&rsquo;s configuration but not accessible via direct URLs. This can also lead to the disclosure of script source code that should only be executed as CGI.</p>
<h3 id="cve-2024-38475">CVE-2024-38475</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475">CVE-2024-38475</a> is a CVE in <code>mod_rewrite</code>, where improper escaping of output allows attackers to map URLs to filesystem locations that should be inaccessible via direct URLs. This can result in arbitrary code execution or the exposure of sensitive source code.</p>
<h2 id="mod_proxy">mod_proxy</h2>
<p>From the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html">official documentation</a>: mod_proxy and related modules implement a proxy/gateway for Apache HTTP Server, supporting a number of popular protocols as well as several different load balancing algorithms. Third-party modules can add support for additional protocols and load balancing algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="cve-2024-38473">CVE-2024-38473</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473">CVE-2024-38473</a> is a CVE in mod_proxy where an encoding issue allows incorrectly encoded request URLs to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication through crafted requests. This affects configurations that proxy requests using methods other than ProxyPass, ProxyPassMatch, or RewriteRule with the &lsquo;P&rsquo; flag, such as SetHandler or unintended proxying via <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39573">CVE-2024-39573</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cve-2024-38477">CVE-2024-38477</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38477">CVE-2024-38477</a> is a CVE in mod_proxy which allows an attacker to crash the server by sending a crafted request that causes a null pointer dereference.</p>
