      <description>&lt;p&gt;PC is an easy Linux box that has a grpc service and a vulnerable version of an application running on it. While doing this box, I had gone to the forums for a hint, and I saw a comment that said something along the lines of “I wrote a script that can solve this box”. I found this quite intriguing and decided to write a script that could solve the box myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
