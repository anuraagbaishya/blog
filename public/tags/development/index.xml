      <title>XSS via Code Injection in NiceGUI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/nicegui-xss/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NiceGUI is a Python framework that lets you build web-based UIs directly in Python, with no HTML/CSS/JS required. It handles both the frontend and backend, making it easy to create interactive dashboards, tools, and apps with a clean, declarative API. To be able to do this, NiceGUI has functions that construct Javascript code from input received through Python code. One of these functions, &lt;code&gt;run_method()&lt;/code&gt;, was vulnerable to quote injection that allowed providing input in ways that led to XSS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Free Resources to Build and Deploy Apps</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/free-app-dev-deploy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, an app building bug bit me. This was a result of me finding an app that solved a problem I was facing, but it was not free. For a long time, the apps I built for myself were CLI only, as I did not have the skills or the patience to develop a web UI (especially writing HTML and CSS). A CLI would however not work for the usecase in question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
