      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, an app building bug bit me. This was a result of me finding an app that solved a problem I was facing, but it was not free. For a long time, the apps I built for myself were CLI only, as I did not have the skills or the patience to develop a web UI (especially writing HTML and CSS). A CLI would however not work for the usecase in question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
