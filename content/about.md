Hello friend! Thank you for stopping by! If you have stumbled upon this page, you might be looking to know more about me. My name is Anuraag Baishya. Some of my friends like to call me "Bayesian" which is why this blog is titled *Bayesian Blog*. 

By day I work on Palo Alto Networks' PSIRT team as a Sr. Staff Product Security Engineer, dealing with all things PSIRT such as handling reports and incidents, working with our engineers to investigate said reports and help them fix bugs, releasing advisories, and any other operations you would imagine a PSIRT personnel would need to handle.

Prior to that I spent a few years working on Application Security at Adobe - doing traditional appsec things like threat modelling, security reviews, code reviews, and sometimes pen testing. I also built some backend components for Adobe's static analysis platform.

I am interested in various things in the world of security. This blog is an attempt to talk about my (mis)adventures in this field. You might stumble upon posts about reading (and writing) code, CTF writeups, the occasional job interview preparation guides, and hopefully some original security research.

I don't expect myself to post here regularly, although I try to at the beginning of every year, but as time goes by, I get lazy. Further, I like to spend my time outside of work looking at other screens I own (such as my phone or my TV) - or if I am feeling adventurous - hiking, travelling, trying out restaurants, and cooking. I have not yet decided if I will sometimes write about my (mis)adventures unrelated to security.

My other interests include watching the NBA (particularly the Warriors, but occasionally I will watch others play too). I also enjoy learning about NBA history - past players and their careers, beefs, championships, and other stories. I am a sneakerhead, partial towards Jordans. My sneaker goals for the next couple years are i) to explore non Nike sneakers, and ii) own one pair (in any colorway) of all the Jordans MJ wore. I have a keen interested in high horology (i.e. watches I can't afford) - and spend a lot of time imagining what it would feel like to own a [A.
